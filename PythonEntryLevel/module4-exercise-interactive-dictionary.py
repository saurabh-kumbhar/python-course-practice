# Write a program that implements a simple interactive dictionary. Start by prompting the user with the following:
#
# Enter a word in English or EXIT: << put a space at the end of this message
#
# When the user enters EXIT in capital letters, terminate the program with the following:
#
# Bye!
#
# Otherwise, try to find the German equivalent in the dictionary provided in the exercise.
#
# a. if the word is in the dictionary, print: Translation: {} << replace {} with the word from the dictionary
# b. if the word is not in the dictionary, print: No match!
#
# You should keep asking the user for new words with the same prompt ('Enter a word in English or EXIT: ') until the user provides EXIT.
#
# Here's an example of how the program could work with user input shown in the bold:
#
#   Enter a word in English or EXIT: dog
#   No match!
#   Enter a word in English or EXIT: face
#   Translation: Gesicht
#   Enter a word in English or EXIT: EXIT
#   Bye!

sample_dict = {
    "mouth": "Mund",
    "finger": "Finger",
    "leg": "Bein",
    "hand": "Hand",
    "face": "Gesicht",
    "nose": "Nase"
}

while True:
    input_word = input('Enter a word in English or EXIT: ')

    if input_word == 'EXIT':
        print('Bye!')
        break

    if input_word in sample_dict:
        print('Translation:', sample_dict[input_word])
    else:
        print('No match!')
